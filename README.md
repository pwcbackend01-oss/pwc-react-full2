# pwc-react-full2

This workspace contains a minimal Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold created for development.

Quick start

```bash
# install dependencies (use --ignore-scripts if you hit lifecycle script issues)
npm install

# start dev server (open http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev

# build for production
npm run build

# preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

Notes

- The dev server runs on port 5173 by default.
- If `npm install` fails due to lifecycle scripts, retry with:

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
```

- Changes were committed and pushed to `origin/main`.

If you'd like I can add testing, linting, or CI next.
